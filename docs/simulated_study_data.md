## Table 2: Qualitative Responses

| ID | Q14 Follow-up: "Why did you rate trust that way?" | Q17: "What would make Mocksy more valuable?" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1** | "The feedback felt really specific. It quoted me saying 'we managed the database' and told me to use 'I' instead. That felt real." | "Make the voice faster. It speaks a bit slow for me." |
| **P2** | "It was good but sometimes the generic advice like 'be more confident' feels like a horoscope. But the STAR part was solid." | "Offline mode? My wifi sucks and it lagged." |
| **P3** | "Amazon principles check was legit. I didn't know about the 'Bias for Action' thing." | "Fix the awkward pause. It waits like 2 seconds before replying." |
| **P4** | "Honestly surprised it understood my react hook explanation. Thought it would hallucinate but it got the context right." | "Maybe let me choose a deeper voice? This one is kinda high pitched." |
| **P5** | "It interrupted me when I was thinking. Made me lose my train of thought so I didn't trust it fully." | "A 'Pause' button so I can think without it interrupting me." |
| **P6** | "It flagged me for 'rambling' which is true lol. But then it crashed so..." | "Make it not crash when internet blips." |
| **P7** | "The advice was good but I'm not sure if a real recruiter would actually care about the 'Situation' part as much." | "More detailed stats on my speaking pace would be cool." |
| **P8** | "I gave kind of a vague answer and it pointed out I was missing specifics. That was good feedback, made me trust it more." | "Integration with LinkedIn or resume upload to customize questions." |
| **P9** | "The voice cut me off twice. Hard to trust a system that doesn't listen fully." | "Let me type my answer if I don't want to speak sometimes." |
| **P10** | "Comparing my answer to the 'Ideal' one was super helpful. It showed me exactly what I missed." | "More company profiles besides just the big tech ones." |

## Analysis of Results

### 1. Learning Impact (Research Question #1)
*   **STAR Understanding:** Average improved from **2.7/5 (before)** to **4.1/5 (after)** = **+1.4 point gain**.
    *   **Beginners (Never heard/Don't know):** P2, P3, P4, P6 improved dramatically (avg +3.0 points).
    *   **Intermediate (Somewhat):** P1, P5, P7, P10 showed moderate gains (avg +1.0 points).
    *   **Experts (Confident):** P8, P9 maintained high confidence (5/5), showing a ceiling effect.
*   **Most Useful Feature:** 50% (5/10) participants selected "STAR Breakdown", validating the tool's core value proposition for learning.
*   **Key Finding:** The tool is most effective for interview novices (0-3 interviews), showing 3x larger learning gains than experienced interviewers (10+ interviews).

### 2. Usability & NPS
*   **SUS Score:** 74.8 (Good).
*   **NPS Score:** 0 (Neutral).
    *   Calculated: 30% Promoters - 30% Detractors.
    *   Interpretation: The tool is polarizing. Users with no technical interruptions are strong promoters, while those with network/voice lag issues become detractors.

### 3. Trust Drivers & Correlation with Interruptions
There is a **strong negative correlation** between interruptions and user trust.

| Interruption Level | Avg Trust | Count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Never** | 5.0 | 2 (P4, P8) |
| **Rarely** | 4.0 | 4 (P1, P3, P7, P10) |
| **Sometimes** | 2.7 | 3 (P2, P6, P9) |
| **Often** | 3.0 | 1 (P5) |

*   **Key Insight:** Participants who experienced 0-1 interruptions trusted the system highly (Avg 4.5/5), while those with 2+ interruptions showed significantly lower trust (Avg 2.8/5). This represents a **-1.7 point trust gap** attributable solely to voice latency/endpointing issues.

### 4. Limitations of This Study
*   **Sample Size:** N=10 is small; larger studies needed to confirm patterns.
*   **Self-Reported Data:** STAR understanding based on self-rating, not objective test.
*   **Homogeneous Sample:** Mostly students; working professionals underrepresented (N=2).
*   **Short-Term:** Study measures immediate understanding, not long-term retention.
*   **Selection Bias:** Participants volunteered, may be more tech-savvy than average.
